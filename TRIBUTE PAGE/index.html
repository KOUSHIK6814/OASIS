              Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
              pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
              Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother
              Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
              between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers
              and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners,
              with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal
              Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had
              involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as
              ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland
              in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s,
              apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy
              he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21]
              In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who
              had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing
              his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint
              Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated
              in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
              Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack
              of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three
              days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress
              and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a
              fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

              <span class="date">Career as a scientist: </span>
              After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
              Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
              Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development
              Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his
              choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
              scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba
              Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
              Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
              (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had
              first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam
              received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]
              Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
              In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight
              Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
              made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which
              proved to be successful.
              Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
              representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
              directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from
              the technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime
              Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers
              under Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the
              true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought
              him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile
              programme under his directorship.[29] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to
              the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal
              for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after
              another.[30] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion
              for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the
              chief executive.[30] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including
              Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile,
              although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[30][31]
              Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research
              and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted
              during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the
              Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][32] Media
              coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.[33] However, the
              director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and
              criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[35]
              In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the
              "Kalam-Raju Stent".[36][37] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural
              areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

              Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[152][153] The Government of India honoured him
              with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his
              role as a scientific advisor to the Government.[154] In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian
              honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence
              technology in India.[155] In 2008 Kalam was the recipient of Hoover Medal.[156] And in 2013, he was the
              recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the
              management and leadership of a space-related project".[157]

              In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[158]

              Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
              birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government
              further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate
              and ₹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to
              residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of
              students.[159]

              On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression
              series.[160]

              Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan in
              New Delhi on 15 October 2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.

              Researchers at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had discovered a new bacterium on the filters of
              the International Space Station (ISS) and named it Solibacillus kalamii to honour the late president Dr.
              A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.[161]

              Several educational and scientific institutions and other locations were renamed or named in honour of
              Kalam following his death.

              Kerala Technological University, headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram where Kalam lived for years, was

              On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at
              the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
              discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[86] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only
              five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[87][88] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a
              critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[87] Despite being placed
              in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m.
              IST.[87][89][90] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing
              well?"[91]

              Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to
              Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules.
              The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president,
              the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian
              Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[92] His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with
              the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous
              dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi
              and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.[93]

              On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown
              to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was
              received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet
              ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and
              Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force
              helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of
              Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus
              station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.[94][95]

              On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state
              honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil
              Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
